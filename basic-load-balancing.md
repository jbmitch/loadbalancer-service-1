# Basic Load Balancing
The IBM Bluemix load balancer service distributes traffic among multiple server instances (bare metal and virtual server) that reside locally, within the same data center. 

## Public Load Balancer 
A publicly-accessible, fully qualified domain name is assigned to your load balancer service instance. You may use this domain name to access your applications hosted behind the load balancer service. The backend compute instances hosting your application must be on an IBM Cloud private network. 

**NOTE:** As a good practice, we recommended that you provision your backend servers as ‘private-only’, unless they require direct public connectivity. This practice helps achieve better security, and it preserves your public IP address. The applications hosted on these backend servers are still accessible over public network using the load balancer.  

## Front-end and Back-end Application Ports/Protocols
You may define up to ten front-end application ports (protocols) and map them to respective ports (protocols) on the back-end application servers. The fully qualified domain name assigned to your load balancer service instance and the front-end application ports are exposed to the external world. The incoming user requests are received on these ports. 

On the other hand, the back-end ports are only known internally. These back-end ports may or may not be the same as the front-end ports. As an example, the load balancer may be configured to receive incoming web/HTTP traffic on front-end port 80, while the back-end servers are listening on custom port 81. 

The supported front-end ports/protocols are HTTP, HTTPS and TCP. The supported back-end ports/protocols are HTTP and TCP. Incoming HTTPS traffic must be terminated at the load balancer to allow for plain-text HTTP communication with the backend server. 

**NOTES:**

* During the initial configuration, you can define up to two front-end ports only. Once a load balancer is created, you can edit port configuration to define additional ports, up to the maximum of ten ports.
* All ten front-end ports must map to the same set of back-end server instances.
* The maximum number of server instances that may be placed behind a load balancer is 50.
* The port range of 56500 to 56520 is reserved for management purposes and cannot be used as front-end virtual ports. 
* TCP port 56501 is used for management. Please ensure that traffic to this port as well as your application's ports are allowed by any firewalls deployed on your public network.

## Load Balancing Methods
The following three load balancing methods are available for distributing traffic among back-end application servers:

* **Round Robin:** Round Robin is the default load balancing method. With this method, the load balancer forwards incoming client connections in round-robin fashion to the back-end servers. As a result, all back-end servers receive roughly an equal number of client connections.

* **Weighted Round Robin:** With this method, the load balancer forwards incoming client connections to the back-end servers in proportion to the weight assigned to these servers. Each server is assigned a default weight of 50, which may be customized to any value between 0 and 100. 

	As an example, if there are three application servers A, B and C, and their weights are customized to 60, 60 and 30 respectively, then servers A and B will receive an equal number of connections, while server C will receive half that number of connections. 

	**NOTES:** 

	* Re-setting a server weight to ‘0’ means no new connections will be forwarded to that server, but any existing traffic will  continue to flow as long as it is active. Using a weight of ‘0’ can help bring down a server gracefully and remove it from service rotation. 
	* The server weight values are applicable only with the 'weighted round robin' method. They are ignored with 'round robin' and 'least connections' load balancing methods. 

* **Least Connections:** With this method, the server instance serving the least number of connections at a given time receives the next client connection.
